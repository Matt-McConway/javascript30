# javascript30

This repo works as a way to record my progress on the Javascript30 program
(A 30 day vanilla Javascript challenge) created by
[Wesbos](https://wesbos.com/).

I started this program to get better at Javascript as I found I wasn't making
as much progress as I would have liked in my other projects, namely the
[cos-comparison](https://github.com/Matt-McConway/cos-comparison) chrome
extension I am working on.
